A simple but cycle-accurate RISC-V full system simulator designed by Drexel DISCO Lab

P.I.: Dr. Anup Das (http://www.anupdas.com/)

Course Projects Based on DREXEL-DISCO-RISC-V-Simulator:
(1) Single-cycle Simulation with Exploration to Multi-core System
(2) Multi-execution Stage Pipeline Simulation with Data Forwarding
(3) Advanced Cache Simulation with Introduction to Cache Coherence Protocol

To compile:
bash compile.bash single-cycle OR
bash compile.bash pipeline

To run:
./RVSim configs/RISC_V.cfg out/test cpu_traces/traces_for_core_0 cpu_traces/traces_for_core_1 <...>
